Step1
-> gnl and save line into structure
-> is_comment 
-> validate room name

Phase 1: number_of_ants
	number_of_ants > 0

Phase 2: the_rooms
	format: name coord_x coord_y
		name:
			cannot start with L or #
			can be unordered
			cannot have the same coord with other room (?)
		coord_x coord_y:
			represented by INT (range: INT_MIN <= coord <= INT_MAX)
Phase 3: the_links
	format: name1-name2
Error:
	empty line
	different phase order
	not enough phases
	##start and ##end happens in other phase than the_rooms
	##start or ##end does not happen at all


Comment starts with #:
	unless:
		##start: modify start room (the line after)
		##end: modify end room (the line after)
Save the line of rooms in structure

Step2
malloc adjacency matrix 



Validation start

# define quatity_of_room

typdef struct s_info{
	int		quantity_of_ants;
	int		quantity_of_rooms; // needed for adjacency matrix 
	char	*name_of_room; // numbering the room but keep name in char array E.g. [0]->room1 [1]->room2
	char	*start_room;
	char	*end_room;
}	t_info;	

typedef struct s_line{
	char *line;
	struct s_line	*s
}	t_line;


# check unique coord:
typedef struct	s_coord {
	int				x;
	int				y;
	char			*room_name; //to check if it's the same room
}				t_coord;
t_coord *coord_array = malloc(sizeof(t_coord) * quantity_of_rooms);
sort then check if there is any repeated coord


---- adjacency matrix ----

Example:

Input:
3
##start
0 1 0
##end
1 5 0
2 9 0
3 13 0
0-2
2-3
3-1

[0]-[2]-[3]-[1]

 | 0  1  2  3
--------------
0| 0  0  8 12
1| 0  0  0  4
2| 8  0  0  4
3| 0 12  4  0

Start -> 0
End -> 1

char or int, do we need to think about distance?

Result:
L1-2
L1-3 L2-2
L1-1 L2-3 L3-2
L2-1 L3-3
L3-1

---- Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix ---
List: Save memory, take longer to find edge
Metrix: More memory, faster to find the edge
-> Lem in requires the faster solving, so Metrix should be the best case?
