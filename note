From STDIN
Phase 1: number_of_ants
Phase 2: the_rooms
Phase 3: the_links

Error:
	empty line
	different phase order
	not enough phases
	##start and ##end happens in other phase than the_rooms
	##start or ##end does not happen at all


Comment starts with #:
	unless:
		##start: modify start room (the line after)
		##end: modify end room (the line after)

Phase 1: number_of_ants
	number_of_ants > 0

Phase 2: the_rooms
	format: name coord_x coord_y
		name:
			cannot start with L or #
			can be unordered
			cannot have the same coord with other room (?)
		coord_x coord_y:
			represented by INT (range: INT_MIN <= coord <= INT_MAX)

Phase 3: the_links
	format: name1-name2
